#### About
This is just a little clone of the popular game minesweeper. Run main.py to play it.

#### Controls
- left click to uncover tiles
- right click to place a flag on a tile
    - right click again to place a questionmark
    - another right click removes the mark
- double click on a numbered tile to uncover unmarked neighbors (works only if the number of 
flagged neighbors equals the number on the clicked tile)
- marked tiles cannot be uncovered
